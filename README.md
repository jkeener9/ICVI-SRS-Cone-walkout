# ICVI-SRS-Cone-walkout
Analyzes portal images from Truebeam to determine cone walk vs. collimator rotation

Take images with cone in place and collimator rotated to as many angles as you like.  I do every 30 deg.  
Most up to date version is "QA Mode"  This analyzes images taken using Machine QA on the truebeam and a dicom test plan I created in Eclipse.  The code inverts these images vs. images taken in service mode.  service mode images can be analyzed using the version named "Windows".  the earliest version was created on my mac and is not as up to date.
